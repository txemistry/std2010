The steps any user has to follow, in order to deploy this application
using the integrated development environment (IDE) “Eclipse”.
We have to launch first the servers, and finally the client.
These are the step to be taken:

1.	Launch the GridServer class. This class can be found in 
    the package: src/domain/server/GridServer.java
2.	Launch the other server, CarServer which is in the 
    route: src/domain/server/CarServer.java
3.	Launch the client class. This class is in the GUI package, 
    because in deed the client is an interface. The class that 
    we must run is ClientGUI and it’s located in the following 
    path: src/GUI/ClientGUI.java
4.	As we use an access database we have to register it in 
    the ODBC of windows. The database is in the path: data/data base/CarDB.mdb
